      <p class="paragraph">BACKGROUND & AIMS  The chromosome region 18q21 has been shown to be frequently deleted in colorectal cancers , and such frequent allelic loss is a hallmark of the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene . The DPC4 gene , which is located at 18q21 , has been identified as a tumor-suppressor gene from examination of pancreatic cancers . The aim of the present study was to determine if it might also be altered in colorectal cancers . METHODS  Mutation analyses of the DPC4 gene were performed on complementary DNA samples from 31 primary colorectal cancer specimens using a combination of polymerase chain reaction , single-strand conformation polymorphism , and DNA sequencing . RESULTS  Four missense mutations producing amino acid substitutions and a somatic 12-base pair deletion in the coding region of the DPC4 gene were detected in the 31 cancers ( 16 % ; 5 of 31 ) . CONCLUSIONS  The DPC4 gene may play a role as a tumor-suppressor gene in a fraction of colorectal cancers ; however , while allelic loss at 18q21 is very often seen in colorectal cancers , only a minority show DPC4 mutations , suggesting that there might be another tumor-suppressor gene in this chromosome region . . And here we have some more special characters Safe characters	Alphanumerics [ 0 - 9 a - z A - Z ] , special characters $ - _ . + ! * ' ( ) , , and reserved characters used for their reserved purposes ( e.g. , question mark used to denote a query string ) NO ASCII Control characters	Includes the ISO-8859-1 ( ISO-Latin ) character ranges 00-1F hex ( 0-31 decimal ) and 7F ( 127 decimal . )	YES. Non-ASCII characters: Includes the entire “top half” of the ISO-Latin set 80-FF hex ( 128-255 decimal. ). Reserved characters	 ; / ? : @ = & ( does not include blank space ). Unsafe characters	Includes the blank/empty space and " < > # % { } | \ ^ ~ [ ] `</p>
